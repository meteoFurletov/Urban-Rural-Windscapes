# Urban-Rural Windscapes Project Overview
The "Urban-Rural Windscapes" project is an in-depth examination of wind dynamics across urban and rural areas within the Saint Petersburg and Leningrad Region. Utilizing data from three weather stations—Kingisepp, Saint Petersburg, and Vojeykovo—the analysis provides comparative insights into wind patterns for the year 2020, emphasizing the differences in wind speed and direction influenced by urbanization and geographic positioning.

## Repository Structure
